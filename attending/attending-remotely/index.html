      <h2>Attending Remotely</h2>

      <h2>Venueless</h2>
<p>For our online attendees, we are holding the conference programs in <strong>Venueless.</strong> You'll enter Venueless via your Pretix confirmation email. Madison has helpfully created this instructional video to help you get into the platform:</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Venueless will open at [TBD] PST</strong> <em>(contrary to what is said in the video)</em></p>
<p><strong>TODO FOR ALAN: Add Flow Block type for YouTube Video embeds</strong></p>
<h3>Accessing the Platform</h3>
<p>You'll have received an order confirmation email after purchasing your ticket. This contains a link to <strong>ticket page</strong> that will look similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="join-online-event.png" alt="Screenshot of a ticket page with a &quot;Join online event&quot; button"></p>
<p>This button won't be available until <strong>Friday April 5th, 2024</strong>, when we'll turn on access to our event platform. After that you'll see the <strong>"Join online event"</strong> button at the top of your order. Click on the link to log into the platform and setup your account.</p>
<h3>Setup Your Profile</h3>
<h4>First Login</h4>
<p>When you login for the first time, you'll be prompted to complete your user profile. It'll first ask you to fill in your <strong>display name</strong> and a <strong>profile photo</strong>. Adding a photo or avatar will make it easier for people to recognize you throughout the event.</p>
<p>These are the first screens you'll encounter when logging in. <strong>You can change all of these later on your profile page.</strong></p>
<p><img src="hi-there.png" alt="Screenshot of the first screen after visiting Venueless, with a &quot;Display Name&quot; field visible."></p>
<p><img src="choose-your-look.png" alt="Screenshot of the Venueless profile selection screen."></p>
<h4>Additional Profile Questions</h4>
<p>We have added a few <strong>optional profile questions</strong>. They'll help you to share some more details about you with the rest of the attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pronouns</strong>: we ask that you add your pronouns to make sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable sharing theirs as well. This'll make it easier to interact with people in a <strong>respectful way</strong> and allows others to address you <strong>the way you prefer to be addressed</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Open To DMs</strong>: you can indicate that you are open to other attendees DM'ing you. Alternatively, you can let others know you'd prefer not to be contacted. <strong>This is a guide for others and not enforced through the platform.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Company/School/Institution</strong>: Feel free to share who you work for or are affiliated with.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>: Share you twitter handle.</li>
<li><strong>Mastodon</strong>: Alternatively or in addition, share your Mastodon user URL.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="optional-questions.png" alt="Screenshot of the profile fields within Venueless&#x27;s first time setup."></p>
<p>This is how others will see your profile information when clicking on your username in the chat.</p>
